# SNHU-CS-230

  Our client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their Android game Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms. The game needs to support multiple users and teams with the ability to run several game instances at the same time. As part of the project, I was asked to design the software architecture and platform requirements to help transition the game from a mobile platform to a multi-platform environment.
  In developing this documentation, I think I did particularly well in organizing complex technical details in a clear way. This helped me keep track of each requirement and feature as I worked through different sections of the template. The process of creating a design document was really useful for development as it forced me to think carefully about each component and how they fit together. It allowed me to plan and visualize the structure of the development before getting into it, which makes the implementation much easier at the end.
  If I were to go back and revise one part of the documentation, I would choose the section on memory and storage management. I would add more specifics about the different memory demands across platforms and how storage solutions might be different, such as using cloud storage versus local disk storage. This would give a greater understanding of the technical requirements for each platform, which could help guide future developers on optimizing the game’s performance.
  Interpreting the user's needs was important for developing a design that would meet their expectations. They required quick load times and secure player information storage, which influenced my choice of platforms and security features. Meeting user needs is very important because it determines the functionality and user experience, which are the main factors in a game’s success.
  In designing this software, I started by analyzing the client’s requirements and the game’s current structure. For future projects I would use similar strategies, like detailed system diagrams and considerations for each platform, to allow me to break down the requirements and organize the design. This way, I can ensure each feature aligns with user needs and the demands that come with multi-platform environments.
